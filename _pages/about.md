title: "About Me"
---

I'm a data scientist and machine learning practitioner with experience developing deep learning, NLP, and classical ML models across domains including bioinformatics, medical documentation, and time-series forecasting. My background spans both industry and research environments, and I specialize in building end-to-end solutions—from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model deployment and stakeholder communication.

I’ve designed and deployed models using Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, AWS, SQL, and modern ML toolkits. Much of my recent work focuses on deep learning architectures such as CNNs, transformers, and LSTMs. I enjoy working closely with cross-functional teams—scientists, engineers, business leaders—to translate complex technical insights into actionable decisions.

Previously, I worked as a Deep Learning Scientist at Syngenta, where I developed gene-expression prediction models that significantly improved accuracy, streamlined internal workflows, and informed biological decision-making. At Infinia ML, I contributed to NLP model pipelines for medical document understanding, standardized large-scale datasets, and authored research guiding future projects.

Before transitioning fully into data science, I worked in engineering roles within the medical device and robotics sectors, gaining experience in testing, analysis, regulatory compliance, and hands-on prototyping.

I'm passionate about applied machine learning, generative AI, and solving challenging problems with data. I also teach an Advanced Generative AI course, helping professionals learn modern deep learning techniques and model-building workflows.

Outside of work, I enjoy developing ML side projects, teaching, and exploring new ways to make cutting-edge ML tools more accessible.
