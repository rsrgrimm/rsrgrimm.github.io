## 📌 Overview
This project builds a predictive model for housing prices using data from Kaggle.  
I compare baseline linear models with tuned XGBoost models.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📊 Key Results
- RMSE improved by **18%** over baseline.
- Most important features were: latitude, longitude, and square footage.

## 📝 Methodology
1. Cleaned dataset (null imputation, outlier removal)  
2. Exploratory data analysis  
3. Linear & tree-based baseline models  
4. XGBoost tuning with Bayesian optimization  
5. Evaluation & visualization
